# Introduction

This repository is a collection regular expressions for secret and private information:

* Authentication tokens & keys (e.g. Google API Key)
* National Identification (e.g. Social Security Number)
* Finance (e.g. credit cards)


# Sources

The sources for these regular expressions are primarily open source repositories. 
Where possible, credit is given in the CONTRIBUTIONS.md file.

In addition, ChatGPT is used to supplement the collection. For example, the PII and financial patterns were provided by ChatGPT.


# Accuracy

No guarantee as to the accuracy of this data is promised, whatsoever. In particular, you should view patterns generated by ChatGPT with suspicion. 

To properly test these patterns, we would need a collection of real (yet revoked / invalidated) data, on which to test. That is a big project in and of itself, and is currently TBD.
